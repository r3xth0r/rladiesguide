## About

The R-Ladies Global Team is comprised of the 

* the Leadership Team, who are officially on the Board of Directors for global
non-profit organization.

* various smaller teams that are critical to operations that support chapter activity
and global presence.

The best description of the members and roles of the Global Team is at <https://rladies.org/about-us/global-team/>. We do our best to keep this up to date;
however, global team members are regularly on-boarding or off-boarding, and new teams
are being formed, so please keep in mind this might not be an exact
representation.

Global Team members often serve in more than one role as the need arises; for example,
an individual can serve on both the leadership team and the website team.

## Our Values

## Our Expectations

### Commitment

As R-Ladies is a purely volunteer run organisation, we respect and encourage your need to have vacations, free-time and focus on other aspects of your life. The hours spent on R-Ladies work should happen when you are truly available to do them. We do ask those that are seeking to join the Global Team commit to one year of service (of course, we would understand if life interrupts this commitment), and an estimate of the weekly time commitment is 1 to 4 hours a week. In addition, the needs of the specific roles may vary: some volunteers work on a weekly, monthly, or quarterly basis due to natural workload fluctuations.

If a volunteer needs to temporarily pause their responsibilities for any reason
(e.g., work, health, or vacation) please let the leadership team know so that we
may fill your role during your absence.

If a volunteer is ready to exit the Global Team for any reason, please let the leadership
team know. If you are capable, we would appreciate it if you have the capacity to on-board a new
team member to your role; but if you are unable, we understand.

We suspect that after a service over time in a specific role you will be ready to
try a new role, if you wish to continue on the Global Team. If you have reached that
point, please let the leadership team know so that we may re-assign you to role
that aligns with your current interests.

### Communication

Our primary communication channel is Slack, and the common language we communicate in is English. We hope for Global Team members to regularly check Slack; if the team member is not present on Slack, then we require them to be responsive via email.

### Contact

If you are an organizer but not in the global team, the quickest way to contact the leadership team is to use `#help-ask_the_leadership` in the R-Ladies Organizer slack.

If you are on Global Team, you can communicate with other other members of the global
team (including the leadership team) on the private `#team-global` channel
in the R-Ladies Organizer slack.

### Operations

Individual teams within the Global Team may operate relatively independently from the Global Team or may work more closely with the Global Team. Individual teams may establish their own work preferences or set their own small team meetings. In addition, many, but not all, members of the Global Team serve on multiple individual teams. Lastly, applying to a specific team does not mean your contributions or communications are limited to that team. Individual teams often solicit and receive feedback or assistance from other members of the Global Team.
